This is a project developed under the intrests of building an OCR which should be made public for the usage of digitizing the ancient language telugu. Unavailability of accessible and accurate Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a major constraint in transforming Telugu into an internet language and making it hard for preserving the literary works of Ancient telugu, telugu had a popular writer base and almost each writer has his style of writing making it more difficult to train models on a particular base of author as the deep learning solutions requires training on recognizing and matching that fonts with the machine readable format unicodes, this is done using the Directed acyclic graphs, there are different approaches and for all it matters the accurate one is the one that stands out of the crowd. Several researchers has used several different solutions with the same goal of solving the same problem and almost for the same reason.

This project is a continuation of the works by Dr.Raj Reddy (http://www.rr.cs.cmu.edu/mbdl.htm)
